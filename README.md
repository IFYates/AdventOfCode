# AoC2021
My [Advent of Code 2021](https://adventofcode.com/2021) solutions.

Aiming at clean, maintainable code, nothing clever.

Working with [dotnet-script](https://github.com/filipw/dotnet-script) via VSCode. No IDE auto-complete help and working from memory of APIs/SDKs as much as possible.

Not including the problem inputs.
